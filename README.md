# RosharGlyphsJs

Glyphs are a writing system used on Roshar for basic communication, artistic expression, and religious practices. Individual glyphs represent specific ideas. They are typically symmetrical and can be rendered with varying degrees of stylization. Two glyphs may be combined into a glyphpair, forming a word distinct from the constituent glyphs. Glyphs and glyphpairs are often designed as pictographs so that literacy is not required for comprehension. The writing system is not structured to facilitate the composition of sentences or more complex communication. 

And then I ruin it.

Matrix piece using P5Js to form this shapes similar to Roshar Glyphs. This kind of caligraphy is based in the stormlight saga from brandon sanderson.

Welcome to my humble tribute.

Life before death.
